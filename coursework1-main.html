<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this coursework, you will demonstrate your ability with the C
programming language and its standard library by writing a
<strong>steganography</strong> program which encodes and decodes secret messages in
bitmap images.</p>
<p>This coursework contributes to the following learning outcomes of
the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to develop efficient, resource-conscious code.</li>
<li>Practical skills in low-level, systems programming, with effective
  resource management.</li>
<li>Ability to articulate system-level operations and to identify
  performance implications of given systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an <strong>individual</strong> assessment. The code and documentation you
submit must be entirely your own work.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please ask me &lt;<code>a.sampson@hw.ac.uk</code>&gt;.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>This coursework involves writing a simple steganography program in C,
called <code>steg</code>. <code>steg</code> can operate in two modes &mdash; encode and decode
&mdash; selected by the first command-line argument being <code>e</code> or <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>An RGB colour bitmap image consists of a grid of pixels, each of which
has red, green and blue colour values. To <strong>encode</strong> text inside an
image, your program will replace the red value in successive random
pixels in the image with characters from the text, outputting a new
image.</p>
<p>When encoding, your program will be invoked as:</p>
<pre><code>./steg e old.ppm &gt;new.ppm
</code></pre>
<p>It must prompt for a message to encode, and output the new image to
<code>stdout</code> (in this case we have redirected it to a file).</p>
<p>To <strong>decode</strong> the text, your program will compare the new image with the
old image, and extract characters from the new one where it differs from
the old one.</p>
<p>When decoding, your program will be invoked as:</p>
<pre><code>./steg d old.ppm new.ppm
</code></pre>
<p>It must decode the message and output the hidden text to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<h2>The PPM image format</h2>
<p>You will work with <strong>Plain PPM</strong> format images. This is one of a family
of simple open source image formats, designed to be read and written
easily by C programs.
See <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html">the PPM specification</a>
for full details of PPM and Plain PPM.</p>
<p>A Plain PPM file consists of ASCII text:</p>
<pre><code>P3
# comment1
# ...
# commentN
width height
max
r1 g1 b1
r2 g2 b2
r3 g3 b3
...
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>P3</code> - code indicating Plain PPM format</li>
<li><code>comment</code> - arbitrary optional comment text</li>
<li><code>width</code> - integer number of columns</li>
<li><code>height</code> - integer number of rows</li>
<li><code>max</code> - integer maximum colour value - usually 255</li>
<li><code>ri gi bi</code> - integers between 0 and <code>max</code> for pixel <code>i</code>'s red, green
  and blue values</li>
</ul>
<p>All integers are in decimal.</p>
<p>(From now on, I will refer to Plain PPM just as PPM.)</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>You will need a Linux C development environment, like we have been using
in the practical exercises. This might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a MACS lab machine</li>
<li>a MACS machine remotely, using <a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/cs/faq.html#Qnx">x2go</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/VM/">MACS Linux Virtual Machine</a> on your own computer</li>
<li>a regular Linux installation on your own computer</li>
</ul>
<p>You may like to refer to Hans-Wolfgang Loidl's
<a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/LinuxIntro/t1.html">Linux Introduction</a>.</p>
<h3>Cloning the project</h3>
<p>You are provided with a template project containing an outline source
file. You must use Git and the MACS GitLab Student server to download
the template project and to submit the assessment.</p>
<p>First, fork <a href="https://gitlab-student.macs.hw.ac.uk/f28hs-2021-22/f28hs-2021-22-students/f28hs-2021-22-cwk1-c">this project</a>.</p>
<p>Then clone your fork on your Linux system, e.g. (replacing <code>username</code>
with your username):</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@gitlab-student.macs.hw.ac.uk:username/f28hs-2021-22-cwk1-c.git
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that you can compile the starter code before you start making
changes to the <code>steg.c</code> file. Change into the project directory, and run:</p>
<pre><code>make
</code></pre>
<p>(This may print some warnings because the code is incomplete.)</p>
<p>As you progress through the coursework requirements, push your work to
GitLab. Remember to create small incremental improvements with Git
commits &mdash; you may like to refer to Rob Stewart's
<a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/407df13c-18b7-4163-a1e3-90e5ceb54585?st=921">Introduction to Git video</a>
for the lifecycle of files in a Git repository. When you push your
commits, GitLab will check that your file can be compiled.</p>
<h3>Test dataset</h3>
<p>A collection of PPM image files for you to test your steganography
program with is available from Canvas, under <strong>Course Information &gt;
Assessment</strong>.</p>
<p>You may notice some PPM files in this collection have a new line after
every colour value, whilst others have the R, G and B values for a pixel
on one row. Either is fine &mdash; the PPM specification allows any kind
of whitespace between numbers. </p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>This project as a whole is marked out of 20 points, and makes up 50% of
your final mark for the course.</p>
<p>The program overall should be valid C99 (or later), and should be robust
against error.</p>
<p>Work through the steps below in order.</p>
<h3>1 - (2 points) Storing PPM images</h3>
<p>In <code>steg.c</code>, complete the declaration of <code>struct PPM</code>, which holds the
image read from a PPM file.</p>
<p>This will need to include the information from the PPM header (<code>width</code>,
<code>height</code>, <code>max</code>), and a pointer to a dynamically-allocated array
containing the pixel data. Your program should be able to deal with PPM
files with arbitrary numbers of rows and columns.</p>
<h3>2 - PPM functions</h3>
<p>Implement in <code>steg.c</code> the following functions.</p>
<p>You may also write additional helper functions or type declarations if
you like. The template includes some already, e.g. <code>struct Pixel</code> and
<code>readPPM</code>, but you can rename or remove these provided you implement
<code>struct PPM</code>, <code>getPPM</code>, <code>showPPM</code>, <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code>.</p>
<h4>2a - (2 points) Reading PPM files</h4>
<pre><code>struct PPM *getPPM(FILE *f);
</code></pre>
<p>to return a new <code>struct PPM</code>, containing the PPM image read from open
file <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>Use the <code>fscanf</code> function to read numbers from the file. Once you know
<code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, construct a dynamic array of the appropriate size.
Don't worry about handling comments in the PPM file for now.</p>
<h4>2b - (2 points) Writing PPM files</h4>
<pre><code>void showPPM(const struct PPM *img);
</code></pre>
<p>to output the PPM image <code>img</code> to <code>stdout</code> (e.g. by using <code>printf</code>),
following the syntax in the PPM specification.</p>
<p>You should test this function by using it to write out an image loaded
with <code>getPPM</code>. The template code's <code>main</code> function has an extra <code>t</code> mode
for this.</p>
<h4>2c - (2 points) Encode data</h4>
<pre><code>struct PPM *encode(const char *text, const struct PPM *img);
</code></pre>
<p>to return a copy of PPM image <code>img</code> with message <code>text</code> hidden in its
red pixel values.</p>
<p>You will need to make it replace successive random red pixels with the
characters from the message. How you select pixels is up to you, but
make sure that the pixels are chosen in a consistent order (e.g. left to
right, top to bottom) and enough pixels are selected to encode all of
the message.</p>
<h4>2d - (2 points) Decode data</h4>
<pre><code>char *decode(const struct PPM *oldimg, const struct PPM *newimg);
</code></pre>
<p>to return a new string containing the message hidden in the red pixel
values of PPM image <code>newimg</code>, by comparing it with the red pixel values
of PPM image <code>oldimg</code>.</p>
<p>The length of the string that it allocates and returns will depend on
the length of the message. You may impose a limit on the maximum length
of a decoded message if this makes the implementation easier.</p>
<h3>3 - (6 points) Steganography program</h3>
<p>Complete the main behaviour of the <code>steg</code> program, which encodes or
decodes images based on its command-line arguments as described above.</p>
<h3>4 - (2 points) Additional PPM features</h3>
<p>For an additional 2 points, implement <strong>one</strong> of the following two
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make <code>getPPM</code> and <code>showPPM</code> read and write comments, by storing the
  comments as a linked list of strings in <code>struct PPM</code>. You can assume
  that any comment lines will always be immediately before <code>width</code>
  (although the PPM specification says they're allowed to occur anywhere
  in the file). You will need to rework how you read <code>width</code> &mdash; if
  the first character you read is a <code>#</code>, then you have a comment, else
  it must be a digit and should be counted as part of <code>width</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <code>getPPM</code> handle normal PPM files as well as Plain PPM. Normal
  PPM files start with <code>P6</code> instead of <code>P3</code>, and have the image data
  stored directly as bytes (one or two bytes per colour, depending on
  <code>max</code>) rather than as decimal numbers &mdash; see the PPM
  specification for more details. You can read data like this using the
  <code>fread</code> function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5 - (2 points) Report</h3>
<p>In <code>Report.md</code>, you should give a <strong>brief</strong> description &mdash; no more
than a couple of pages of text &mdash; of:</p>
<ul>
<li>your program design</li>
<li>your choice of data structures and algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>Write <code>Report.md</code> using Markdown syntax, which will allow GitLab to
render it nicely as HTML. See the
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">Markdown Guide</a>, or the
help within GitLab, for more details.</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Submission is due by 15:00 on Tuesday 22nd February through the MACS
GitLab Student server.</p>
<p>To submit coursework 1, you must <strong>push</strong> your code to your fork of
<code>f28hs-2021-22-cwk1-c</code> on the MACS GitLab Student server.</p>
<p>Your project on GitLab must include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>steg.c</code> - your implementation of image steganography.</li>
<li><code>Report.md</code> - your report describing your implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plagiarism Policy</h2>
<p>This coursework is individual work. It is not group work, and you are
assessed individually. Therefore, the code and report you submit for
this lab must be entirely your own. You must not share your code with
other students, and you must not copy code solutions from others.
The <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/students/doc/plagiarismguide.pdf">university plagiarism policy</a>
is clear: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><q>Plagiarism involves the act of taking the ideas, writings or
inventions of another person and using these as if they were one's
own, whether intentionally or not.</q> Definition 2.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We run plagiarism detection software against <strong>all</strong> source code
submissions to identify any code similarity across multiple
submissions. The minimum disciplinary action for plagiarism is an award
of an F grade (fail) for the course, and serious instances of plagiarism
will result in compulsory withdrawal from the university.</p>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The PPM specification is usually available as a manual page
  on Linux &mdash; try <code>man 5 ppm</code>.</li>
<li>You should check that the output image looks reasonable. Many
  image viewers and editors are capable of reading PPM files,
  e.g. shotwell, eog, gimp, feh, xli...</li>
<li>You can use <code>od</code> to look at the raw bytes inside a PPM file.
  For example: <code>od -x -a ape.ppm | more</code></li>
<li>C's <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> includes a basic random number generator. The
  <code>srand(seed)</code> function initialises the random number generator with a
  given unsigned integer, then subsequent calls to <code>rand()</code> will return
  a number in the range <code>0</code> to <code>RAND_MAX</code>. You can get a value in the
  range 0 to N - 1 with <code>rand() % N</code>.</li>
<li>Clue: what happens if a letter you're going to hide has the same value
  as the pixel component it's going to replace?</li>
</ul></body>
